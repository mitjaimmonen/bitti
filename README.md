1-bit journal

## The plan

- Main journal view:
  - Columns for each topic
  - Rows for each day
- Topic types
  - Note: Create diary entries and notes for each day
  - Boolean: Track habits with simple yes/no answers
  - Number: Track numerical things for each day
- Notes view
  - View all notes in chronological order
  - Filter notes by topic
  - Add new notes to a topic
- Settings view
  - Dark mode
  - Language
  - Export data
  - Import data
  - User / login / logout: Save data to the cloud
  - Pro membership: Does nothing useful, essentially a donation
- Flavors
  - GPlay version: Login and cloud sync, pro membership
  - FDroid version: No login, no cloud sync, full functionality otherwise
- Platforms
  - Android
  - iOS
  - Web
